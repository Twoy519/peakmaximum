      <description>Background My wife and I moved to London in early 2017. One of the first things we did when we got here was visit the Tate Museum. While there, I walked by a subtle trio of drawings by an artist I had never heard of. I took a photo of my favorite and kept walking.
It is about two years later (July 2019) and we now have a five month old daughter.</description>

 Some of the datasets I deal with are lognormally distributed. Basically what this means is they follow the 80/20 rule where 80% of the sum of the values comes from the top 20% of the observations when sorted descending. There are a lot of observations with very low values relative to the range. Often I bucket things into bins for reporting based on log base-10 rule where we bucket “observations less than 10”, then observations less than 100 then 1,000 then 10,000 etc.</description>
