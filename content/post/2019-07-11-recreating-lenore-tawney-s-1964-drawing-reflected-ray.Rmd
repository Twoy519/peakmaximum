# Background

My wife and I moved to London in early 2017. One of the first things we did when we got here was visit the Tate Museum. While there, I walked by a subtle trio of drawings by an artist I had never heard of. I took a photo of my favorite and kept walking.

It is about two years later (July 2019) and we now have a five month old daughter. We immediately started to back up every photo we ever took of anything. It was during this process that I stumbled upon my original image:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px"}

knitr::include_graphics("/img/lenore_tawney_iphone_photo.jpg")

```

The artist is [Lenore Tawney](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/lenore-tawney-24528), an American who worked in the mid-20th century. She is actually more well-known for her work with "fiber" and yarn but she has what I think is a [beautiful collection of Ink Drawings](http://lenoretawney.org/lenore-tawney/work/drawing/).

The one I captured at the Tate that day in 2017 is called ["Reflected Ray"](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/tawney-reflected-ray-l03880). I loved the geometry and simplicity of this work. The medium of simple ink on 1960's industrial draft paper I thought was also really beautiful and cool.

# Using [ggpomological](https://github.com/gadenbuie/ggpomological)

I ran into [ggpomological](https://github.com/gadenbuie/ggpomological) a while ago and I thought it looked awesome. Unfortunately, I didn't see much application in the work environment where I spend 99% of my R time. When I was looking at the Lenore Tawney artwork again today though I thought it would be a fun application of the [`paint_pomological()` feature](https://github.com/gadenbuie/ggpomological) which uses `magick` to give a ggplot output the look of hand-drawing on paper. In this demo I'll use this feature to make a pretty cool rendering of Lenore Tawney's Reflected Ray in ggplot.

# R Code

We'll use ggplot2 for plotting, and ggpomological for the theme and paper effect.

```{r}
require( 'ggplot2')
require( 'ggpomological')
```

In order to generate the dataset, I visually picked out the x and y coordinates for the main nodes, categorized the lines into some rough "groups" based on their color and what component of the entire illustration I thought they comprised, and then counted the number of lines between the nodes of that smaller component. I then evenly spaced lines in between the starting and ending nodes in order to generate the rough x and y coordinates for the entire component.


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px"}

knitr::include_graphics("/img/tawney_drafting_screencap.png")

```

I uploaded the file with the resulting data to my repo for this site:

```{r}
d.in <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Twoy519/peakmaximum/master/data_assets/reflected_ray_data.csv')

head(d.in)
```

I originally thought I was going to have to do something crazy with `geom_line` but a quick check for a better way revealed `geom_segment` to be a one-liner. Each line has a color as well as the starting point {x1, y1} and the ending point {x2, y2}. We can feed these coordinates into `geom_segment`'s x1, xend, y1 and yend aesthetics.

## Plot

The plot below follows this high-level logic:

1. We can use `geom_segment` to pass the coordinates and the colors

2. The original artwork is basically a 160 wide by 200 tall grid, with the major gridlines breaking on the 10's. We pass `expand=c(0,0)` to the `scale_*_continuous` pieces in order to bring the axes right up to the edge of the plot area panel.

3. I downloaded the font ['Homemade Apple'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Homemade+Apple/) which looked good enough to pass for the title of the piece in the bottom left. This is passed by default into `theme_pomological_fancy()`

4. I turn off the axis labels, format the major and minor grid components, and stick the caption in the bottom left.

5. I set the colors

```{r, cache=F}
plt <- ggplot(d.in) +
  geom_segment(aes(x=x1, y=y1, xend=x2, yend=y2, color=color), alpha = 0.2) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    limits = c(0,160)
    , breaks = seq(0,160, by = 10)
    , minor_breaks = seq(0,160, by = 1)
    , expand = c(0,0)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0,200)
    , breaks = seq(0,200, by = 10)
    , minor_breaks = seq(0,200, by = 1)
    , expand = c(0,0)
    , position='right'
  ) +
  labs(
    caption='Reflected ray'
  ) +
  theme_pomological_fancy() +
  theme(
    legend.position = 'none'
    , axis.text = element_blank()
    , axis.title = element_blank()
    , panel.grid.major = element_line(color = '#E4AA84', size = 0.5, linetype=1)
    , panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = '#E4AA84', size = 0.25, linetype=1)
    , panel.border = element_rect(color = '#E4AA84')
    , plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, color = 'dark gray')
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c('black','#8F0F01'))

```

Our plot looks like this with the default ggplot output

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=3.67}
plt
```


The piece that puts the icing on the cake here in terms of making the font look more like handwriting and the background look more like paper is set with `paint_pomological`.

```{r}
paint_pomological(
  plt
  , res = 110
  , width = 180 * 5
  , height = 220 * 5
)
```

Â ðŸ”¥ And there ya go! ðŸ”¥

And then just for fun we'll Andy Warhol it up

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px"}

knitr::include_graphics("/img/lenore_tawney_palettes_small.jpg")

```
