My name is Troy. I am a data analyst based in London. Everything I write here represents my own thought and opinions.

What does Peak Maximum mean? Not sure, one of my friends said something about taking something to the Peak Maximum and I thought it was funny and the domain name was available for $5.00 and I needed something to do.
