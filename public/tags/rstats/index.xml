 Some of the datasets I deal with are lognormally distributed. Basically what this means is they follow the 80/20 rule where 80% of the sum of the values comes from the top 20% of the observations when sorted descending. There are a lot of observations with very low values relative to the range. Often I bucket things into bins for reporting based on log base-10 rule where we bucket “observations less than 10”, then observations less than 100 then 1,000 then 10,000 etc.</description>
