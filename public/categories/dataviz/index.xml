      <description>Background My wife and I moved to London in early 2017. One of the first things we did when we got here was visit the Tate Museum. While there, I walked by a subtle trio of drawings by an artist I had never heard of. I took a photo of my favorite and kept walking.
It is about two years later (July 2019) and we now have a five month old daughter.</description>
