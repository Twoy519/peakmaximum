![The Train Schedule](/img/train_schedule.png)

This website needs content. I don't really know what to write at the moment so I'm going to just start with a simple recreation of a 137 year old data visualization to get things rolling. I could have chosen to write about Napoleon's infamous march but [plenty](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/analyzing-minards-visualization-of-napoleons-1812-march) [of](https://datavizblog.com/2013/05/26/dataviz-history-charles-minards-flow-map-of-napoleons-russian-campaign-of-1812-part-5/) [people](https://flowingdata.com/2008/07/17/is-minards-map-of-napoleons-march-the-greatest-statistical-graphic-ever/) [write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwwSHpPZdc) [about](http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/229-vital-statistics-of-a-deadly-campaign-the-minard-map) [that](http://fportman.com/blog/visualizing-napoleon-s-march-to-moscow/) [already](https://cartographia.wordpress.com/2008/04/30/napoleons-invasion-of-russia/).

I recently purchased a copy of [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142](The Visual Display of Quantitative Information) by Edward Tufte. The cover image is a photo of E.J. Marey's visualization of train scheduls for Paris to Lyon. I'll go ahead and try to recreate this in R.
