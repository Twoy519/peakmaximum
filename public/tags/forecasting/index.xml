      <description>As a followup to my post about visualizing Prophet Forecast Output, this post will do the same process of combing purrr/furrr and prophet to run a lot of forecasts in a more structured way and then visualizing the results with gganimate.
The purpose of this post will be to provide a range of input values to the changepoint.prior.scale parameter and observe what it does to Prophet’s forecast and it’s confidence intervals.</description>

      <description>Credit Where Credit is Due The idea and methods of using purrr with Prophet here were not my own. I copied this methodology from a coworker who was kind enough to share this approach below which leverages map() functions to more cleanly structure our input data and apply the forecast function over it many times.
