<h1>Background</h1>
<p>My wife and I moved to London in early 2017. One of the first things we did when we got here was visit the Tate Museum. While there, I walked by a subtle trio of drawings by an artist I had never heard of. I took a photo of my favorite and kept walking.</p>
<p>It is about two years later (July 2019) and we now have a five month old daughter. We immediately started to back up every photo we ever took of anything. It was during this process that I stumbled upon my original image:</p>

<p>The artist is <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/lenore-tawney-24528">Lenore Tawney</a>, an American who worked in the mid-20th century. She is actually more well-known for her work with ‚Äúfiber‚Äù and yarn but she has what I think is a <a href="http://lenoretawney.org/lenore-tawney/work/drawing/">beautiful collection of Ink Drawings</a>.</p>
<p>The one I captured at the Tate that day in 2017 is called <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/tawney-reflected-ray-l03880">‚ÄúReflected Ray‚Äù</a>. I loved the geometry and simplicity of this work. The medium of simple ink on 1960‚Äôs industrial draft paper I thought was also really beautiful and cool.</p>

<h1>Using <a href="https://github.com/gadenbuie/ggpomological">ggpomological</a></h1>
<p>I ran into <a href="https://github.com/gadenbuie/ggpomological">ggpomological</a> a while ago and I thought it looked awesome. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt see much application in the work environment where I spend 99% of my R time. When I was looking at the Lenore Tawney artwork again today though I thought it would be a fun application of the <a href="https://github.com/gadenbuie/ggpomological"><code>paint_pomological()</code> feature</a> which uses <code>magick</code> to give a ggplot output the look of hand-drawing on paper. In this demo I‚Äôll use this feature to make a pretty cool rendering of Lenore Tawney‚Äôs Reflected Ray in ggplot.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-code" class="section level1">
<h1>R Code</h1>
<p>We‚Äôll use ggplot2 for plotting, and ggpomological for the theme and paper effect.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>require( &#39;ggplot2&#39;)
require( &#39;ggpomological&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>In order to generate the dataset, I visually picked out the x and y coordinates for the main nodes, categorized the lines into some rough ‚Äúgroups‚Äù based on their color and what component of the entire illustration I thought they comprised, and then counted the number of lines between the nodes of that smaller component. I then evenly spaced lines in between the starting and ending nodes in order to generate the rough x and y coordinates for the entire component.</p>

<p>I uploaded the file with the resulting data to my repo for this site:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>d.in &lt;- readr::read_csv(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Twoy519/peakmaximum/master/data_assets/reflected_ray_data.csv&#39;)

<p>I originally thought I was going to have to do something crazy with <code>geom_line</code> but a quick check for a better way revealed <code>geom_segment</code> to be a one-liner. Each line has a color as well as the starting point {x1, y1} and the ending point {x2, y2}. We can feed these coordinates into <code>geom_segment</code>‚Äôs x1, xend, y1 and yend aesthetics.</p>
<div id="plot" class="section level2">
<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>The plot below follows this high-level logic:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>We can use <code>geom_segment</code> to pass the coordinates and the colors</p></li>
<li><p>The original artwork is basically a 160 wide by 200 tall grid, with the major gridlines breaking on the 10‚Äôs. We pass <code>expand=c(0,0)</code> to the <code>scale_*_continuous</code> pieces in order to bring the axes right up to the edge of the plot area panel.</p></li>
<li><p>I downloaded the font <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Homemade+Apple/">‚ÄòHomemade Apple‚Äô</a> which looked good enough to pass for the title of the piece in the bottom left. This is passed by default into <code>theme_pomological_fancy()</code></p></li>
<li><p>I turn off the axis labels, format the major and minor grid components, and stick the caption in the bottom left.</p></li>
<li><p>I set the colors</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The piece that puts the icing on the cake here in terms of making the font look more like handwriting and the background look more like paper is set with <code>paint_pomological</code>.</p>
