      <description>The Train Schedule
 This website needs content. I don’t really know what to write at the moment so I’m going to just start with a simple recreation of a famous old ( originally made 137 years ago) visualization to get things rolling. I could have chosen to write about Napoleon’s infamous march but plenty of people wrote about that already.
I recently purchased a copy of https://www.amazon.co.uk/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142 by Edward Tufte.</description>

      <description>My name is Troy. I am a data analyst based in London. Everything I write here represents my own thought and opinions.
What does Peak Maximum mean? Not sure, one of my friends said something about taking something to the Peak Maximum and I thought it was funny and the domain name was available for $5.00 and I needed something to do.</description>
